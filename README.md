![alt text](https://github.com/wangamulaudzi/mock-netflix-retool-dashboard/blob/main/mock-netflix2.png)

This repo links to a small exploration of Netflix movie and TV series data. This project is related to another project in which I designed a dashboard for proprietary carbon emissions' for Barrows Global.

The tech stack included JS Queries, SQL queries, and Retool software.

Link to the Retool Dashboard can be found [here](https://wmulaudzi.retool.com/apps/f877a7c8-3260-11ef-8e5d-131bef5809df/Netflix%20Dashboard). The dashboard's data file can be found in the main branch under the name [netflix1.cs](https://github.com/wangamulaudzi/mock-netflix-retool-dashboard/blob/main/netflix1.csv).
